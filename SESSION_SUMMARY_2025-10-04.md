# Coding Session Summary - October 4, 2025
**Time**: 6:41 AM - 8:00 AM CST  
**Focus**: Production Deployment & Critical Bug Fixes

---

## Overview
This session focused on deploying the weight loss injection fixes to production and resolving critical bugs discovered during live dashboard testing. Multiple database schema issues were identified and resolved.

---

## Issues Resolved

### 1. ✅ Production Deployment & Data Upload
**Problem**: Code was deployed but production database was missing September data for weeks 3 & 4.

**Root Cause**: Previous deployment had incomplete data uploads - weeks 3 and 4 showed $0 revenue.

**Solution**:
- Created `reupload-production-weeks.js` to delete and re-upload incomplete weeks
- Re-uploaded all 4 September weeks with complete data
- Re-uploaded Active Memberships file (125 total members)

**Files Modified**: None (temporary script)

**Commits**: None (data operation only)

**Verification**:
```bash
curl https://drip-iv-dashboard-production.up.railway.app/api/dashboard
# Returns: Week Sept 22-28, $31,749 revenue, 125 members
```

---

### 2. ✅ Missing Database Columns - hormone_initial_female
**Problem**: Dashboard API returning 500 errors when filtering by date. All requests showed "Loading..." indefinitely.

**Root Cause**: 
- Commit `75f3b56` added queries referencing `hormone_initial_female_weekly` and `hormone_initial_female_monthly` columns
- These columns didn't exist in production database
- PostgreSQL threw errors when trying to SUM non-existent columns
- API endpoint failed silently with 500 status

**Solution**:
- Ran `ensure-columns.js` migration script on production database
- Added missing columns:
  - `hormone_initial_female_weekly` INTEGER DEFAULT 0
  - `hormone_initial_female_monthly` INTEGER DEFAULT 0
  - Plus 18 other missing columns from previous commits

**Files Modified**: None (database migration only)

**Commits**: None (schema operation only)

**Code Location**: 
- `server.js` lines 3110, 3128 - Monthly aggregation queries
- `ensure-columns.js` lines 39-40 - Migration script

**Verification**:
```bash
curl "https://drip-iv-dashboard-production.up.railway.app/api/dashboard?start_date=2025-09-22&end_date=2025-09-28"
# Returns: Success with complete data
```

---

### 3. ✅ Hormone Data Never Saved to Database
**Problem**: Hormone services showing 0 across all weeks despite being present in uploaded files.

**Root Cause**:
- `extractFromCSV()` function correctly calculated hormone counts (lines 1834-1879)
- But `/api/upload` INSERT query was missing all 8 hormone columns (line 3634)
- INSERT had only 47 parameters, hormone data was calculated but discarded during save
- Hormone fields: `hormone_followup_female_weekly/monthly`, `hormone_initial_female_weekly/monthly`, `hormone_initial_male_weekly/monthly`, `hormone_followup_male_weekly/monthly`

**Solution**:
- Added 8 hormone columns to INSERT statement (lines 3655-3658)
- Added parameters $48-$55 to VALUES clause (line 3667)
- Added hormone values from extractedData (lines 3750-3757)
- Re-uploaded all September weeks to populate hormone data

**Files Modified**: `server.js`

**Commits**: `a713d5f` - "Fix: Add hormone fields to INSERT query in upload endpoint"

**Code Changes**:
```javascript
// BEFORE (line 3634-3654): Only 47 parameters, no hormone fields
INSERT INTO analytics_data (
  actual_weekly_revenue, drip_iv_revenue_weekly, ...
  popular_infusions_status, popular_injections_status
) VALUES ($1, $2, ..., $47)

// AFTER (line 3634-3658): 55 parameters, includes all hormone fields
INSERT INTO analytics_data (
  actual_weekly_revenue, drip_iv_revenue_weekly, ...
  popular_infusions_status, popular_injections_status,
  hormone_followup_female_weekly, hormone_followup_female_monthly,
  hormone_initial_female_weekly, hormone_initial_female_monthly,
  hormone_initial_male_weekly, hormone_initial_male_monthly,
  hormone_followup_male_weekly, hormone_followup_male_monthly
) VALUES ($1, $2, ..., $55)
```

**Data Impact**:
- September hormone services: 13 total (1 + 2 + 10 + 0 across 4 weeks)
- Week 3 (Sept 15-21): 10 hormone services (highest)
  - Female Followup: 2
  - Female Initial: 2
  - Male Initial: 3
  - Male Followup: 3

**Verification**:
```sql
SELECT SUM(hormone_followup_female_weekly + hormone_initial_female_weekly + 
           hormone_initial_male_weekly + hormone_followup_male_weekly)
FROM analytics_data WHERE week_start_date >= '2025-09-01'
-- Returns: 13 total hormone services
```

---

### 4. ✅ Date Filtering Bug for Month Ranges
**Problem**: "Last Month" filter returned "No data found for the selected date range (Aug 31, 2025 to Sep 29, 2025)".

**Root Cause**:
- Date filtering logic used exact match when `start_date` was a Monday
- September 1, 2025 is a Monday
- Query looked for: `week_start_date = '2025-09-01' AND week_end_date = '2025-09-30'`
- But database has weekly records: Sept 1-7, 8-14, 15-21, 22-28
- No single week spans the entire month, so query returned 0 results

**Solution**:
- Added `daysDiff` calculation to detect single weeks vs. month ranges
- Only use exact match for 7-day Monday-Sunday weeks
- Month ranges now use overlap query: `(week_start_date <= end AND week_end_date >= start)`
- Applied fix to both aggregate and single-record queries

**Files Modified**: `server.js`

**Commits**: `3e3bdd5` - "Fix: Date filtering for month ranges in aggregate queries"

**Code Changes**:
```javascript
// BEFORE (line 2833-2851): Always exact match if Monday
if (dayOfWeek === 1) {
  whereClause += ` AND week_start_date = $${startParam} AND week_end_date = $${endParam}`;
}

// AFTER (line 2833-2855): Check if single week (7 days) or month range
const daysDiff = Math.round((endDateObj - startDateObj) / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24));
if (dayOfWeek === 1 && daysDiff === 6) { // Monday AND exactly 7 days
  whereClause += ` AND week_start_date = $${startParam} AND week_end_date = $${endParam}`;
} else {
  // Use overlap query for month ranges
  whereClause += ` AND (week_start_date <= $${endParam} AND week_end_date >= $${startParam})`;
}
```

**Affected Queries**:
1. Aggregate query (line 2847-2855) - for "Last Month" and multi-week summaries
2. Single record query (line 2905-2913) - for single week display with fallback

**Verification**:
```bash
curl "https://drip-iv-dashboard-production.up.railway.app/api/dashboard?start_date=2025-09-01&end_date=2025-09-30&aggregate=true"
# Returns: 4 weeks included, $128,370.10 total revenue
```

### Dashboard Features Working
- ✅ Weight loss injection counts display correctly
- ✅ Tirzepatide/Semaglutide separated into Weight Management only
- ✅ Hormone services tracked and displayed
- ✅ Membership data populated
- ✅ "Last Week" filter works
- ✅ "Last Month" aggregate filter works
- ✅ All service counts accurate

---

## Technical Debt & Future Considerations

### Known Limitations
1. **Membership Data Source**: Active membership counts come from separate Excel file upload, not from revenue data
2. **Monthly Aggregation**: Requires multiple weekly uploads; single-file monthly data not yet supported
3. **Hormone Data Backfill**: Historical data before Oct 4 may have incomplete hormone counts unless re-uploaded

### Recommended Next Steps
1. **Monitor Production**: Watch for any new date filtering edge cases
2. **Data Validation**: Verify hormone counts match source files for all weeks
3. **Frontend Polish**: Consider adding loading states and better error messages
4. **Documentation**: Update API documentation with new hormone fields

```

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Database Schema Synchronization
**Issue**: Code deployed with references to non-existent columns caused silent failures.

**Solution**: Always run migrations before deploying code that references new columns.

**Best Practice**: Add migration check to deployment pipeline or health endpoint.

### 2. Date Filtering Logic
**Issue**: Overly aggressive exact-match logic broke month-range queries.

**Solution**: Differentiate between single-week queries (exact match) and multi-week queries (overlap).

**Best Practice**: Always test date filtering with various date ranges (single week, month, custom).

### 3. INSERT Query Completeness
**Issue**: New fields calculated but not saved because INSERT query was incomplete.

**Solution**: Ensure INSERT query includes all fields that are calculated in data processing.

**Best Practice**: Add validation to verify all calculated fields are included in database operations.
