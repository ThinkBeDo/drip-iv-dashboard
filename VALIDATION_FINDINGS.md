# Dashboard Data Validation Findings
**Date:** October 7, 2025
**Week Analyzed:** September 29 - October 5, 2025
**Source Files:**
- Patient Analysis (Charge Details & Payments) - V3 - With COGS (5).xls
- Drip IV Active Memberships (4).xlsx

---

## Executive Summary

The validation script comparing source Excel files against the dashboard revealed **significant discrepancies** across multiple metrics. The database import logic is miscounting, misattributing, and creating phantom revenue.

---

## Critical Discrepancies Found

### 1. **Membership Count Errors** ‚ùå

| Metric | Excel (Source) | Dashboard | Difference |
|--------|----------------|-----------|------------|
| **Total Members** | **120** | **115** | **-5** |
| Individual | 85 | 85 | ‚úÖ CORRECT |
| Family | **17** | **16** | **-1** |
| Concierge | **18** | **14** | **-4** |
| Corporate | 0 | 0 | ‚úÖ CORRECT |

**Impact:** Dashboard is underreporting total active memberships by 5 members.

**Root Cause:** Unknown - requires investigation of membership import logic in [import-weekly-data.js](import-weekly-data.js).

---

### 2. **NEW Membership Detection Error** ‚ùå

| Metric | Excel (Source) | Dashboard | Difference |
|--------|----------------|-----------|------------|
| New Individual | 0 | 0 | ‚úÖ CORRECT |
| **New Family** | **2** | **4** | **+2** |
| New Concierge | 0 | 0 | ‚úÖ CORRECT |
| New Corporate | 0 | 0 | ‚úÖ CORRECT |

**Impact:** Dashboard is **doubling** the count of new Family memberships.

**Root Cause:** Likely double-counting the same transactions. Need to investigate:
- The regex pattern `/\bnew\b/i` in [import-multi-week-data.js:217](import-multi-week-data.js#L217)
- Possible duplicate row processing

---

### 3. **Revenue Calculation Errors** ‚ùå

#### Total Weekly Revenue

| Metric | Excel (Source) | Dashboard | Phantom Amount |
|--------|----------------|-----------|----------------|
| **Total Revenue** | **$28,830.94** | **$30,781.04** | **+$1,950.10** |

**Impact:** Dashboard shows $1,950.10 MORE revenue than exists in source data.

**This is a critical data integrity issue.**

#### Revenue by Category

| Category | Excel (Source) | Dashboard | Difference |
|----------|----------------|-----------|------------|
| **IV Therapy** | **$15,639.50** | **$17,123.50** | **+$1,484.00** |
| **Weight Loss** | **$9,680.00** | **$9,680.00** | ‚úÖ CORRECT |
| **Membership** | **$2,669.00** | *(Unknown)* | *Not displayed* |
| **Other** | **$842.44** | *(Unknown)* | *Not displayed* |

**Impact:**
- IV Therapy revenue is **$1,484 higher** than it should be
- Weight Loss is accurate
- Membership and Other revenue are not transparently broken out on dashboard

**Root Cause Hypotheses:**
1. **Duplicate transactions** being counted
2. **Incorrect date filtering** including data outside the week range
3. **Category miscategorization** causing revenue double-counting
4. **Currency parsing errors** creating phantom amounts

---

### 4. **Service Volume Count Errors** ‚ùå

#### IV Infusions

| Metric | Excel (Source) | Dashboard | Difference |
|--------|----------------|-----------|------------|
| **Total Infusions** | **76** | **84** | **+8** |
| Weekday | 66 | 66 | ‚úÖ CORRECT |
| Weekend | **10** | **18** | **+8** |

**Impact:** Dashboard is **overcounting** weekend infusions by 8 services.

#### Injections

| Metric | Excel (Source) | Dashboard | Difference |
|--------|----------------|-----------|------------|
| **Total Injections** | **12** | **12** | ‚úÖ CORRECT |
| Weekday | 10 | 10 | ‚úÖ CORRECT |
| Weekend | 2 | 2 | ‚úÖ CORRECT |

**Impact:** Injection counts are accurate.

**Root Cause:** The base infusion categorization logic is miscounting weekend services. Needs investigation in [import-multi-week-data.js:184-190](import-multi-week-data.js#L184-L190).

---

### 5. **Service Categorization Issues** ‚ö†Ô∏è

**From Excel analysis, current categorization logic:**

| Excel Category | Amount | Notes |
|----------------|--------|-------|
| base_infusion | $9,146.44 | Base IV drips (Energy, Immunity, etc.) |
| injection | $1,160.00 | B12, Tirzepatide injections |
| weight_management | $9,680.00 | Semaglutide/Tirzepatide |
| membership | $2,669.00 | Membership fees |
| infusion_addon | $5,333.06 | Glutathione, NAD, Toradol, Zofran |
| consultation | $0.00 | None this week |
| other | $842.44 | Uncategorized services |

**Issues Identified:**

1. **Add-ons being miscategorized:** Services like Toradol, Zofran, Glutathione, NAD should be "infusion_addon" but some may be going to "other"

2. **NAD dosing confusion:**
   - NAD 250mg/500mg should be base_infusion ‚úÖ
   - NAD 50-200mg should be injection ‚úÖ
   - But NAD add-ons (like "NAD 200mg") are being categorized as "other" when they should be "infusion_addon"

3. **Revenue attribution:**
   - Current logic: `base_infusion` + `infusion_addon` + `injection` ‚Üí IV Therapy revenue
   - Expected: $9,146.44 + $5,333.06 + $1,160.00 = $15,639.50 ‚úÖ (matches Excel)
   - Dashboard shows: $17,123.50 ‚ùå ($1,484 higher)

## Recommended Fixes (Priority Order)

### Priority 1: Revenue Calculation Audit üî¥
**File:** [import-multi-week-data.js](import-multi-week-data.js)

Find and fix the source of $1,950.10 phantom revenue:
1. Add transaction-level logging to track every revenue attribution
2. Check for duplicate row processing
3. Verify date filtering is not including out-of-range transactions
4. Validate currency parsing is not creating rounding errors that accumulate

### Priority 2: Membership Counting Fix üî¥
**File:** [import-weekly-data.js](import-weekly-data.js)

Fix the -5 member undercount:
1. Investigate Family counting logic (off by 1)
2. Investigate Concierge counting logic (off by 4)
3. Verify membership type detection regex patterns
4. Check for case-sensitivity issues

### Priority 3: NEW Membership Detection Fix üü°
**File:** [import-multi-week-data.js:217](import-multi-week-data.js#L217)

Fix the duplicate counting of new Family memberships:
1. Add de-duplication logic
2. Verify the NEW regex pattern `/\bnew\b/i` isn't matching multiple times
3. Add logging to track which rows trigger NEW membership increments

### Priority 4: Weekend Infusion Count Fix üü°
**File:** [import-multi-week-data.js:184-190](import-multi-week-data.js#L184-L190)

Fix the +8 weekend infusion overcount:
1. Review weekend detection logic (`date.getDay() === 0 || date.getDay() === 6`)
2. Check if add-ons are being counted as separate infusions
3. Verify base_infusion detection is not double-counting

### Priority 5: Service Categorization Enhancement üü¢
**File:** [import-weekly-data.js](import-weekly-data.js)

Improve service categorization accuracy:
1. Ensure all add-ons (Toradol, Zofran, Glutathione, NAD) are correctly categorized
2. Review "other" category to ensure nothing is being missed
3. Add logging to track uncategorized services

---

## Testing Plan

1. ‚úÖ **Validation script created** - `validate-dashboard-data.js`
2. ‚è≥ **Run validation against current data** (requires DATABASE_URL connection)
3. ‚è≥ **Implement fixes in priority order**
4. ‚è≥ **Re-upload source files to test fixes**
5. ‚è≥ **Run validation script again to verify fixes**
6. ‚è≥ **Generate final comparison report**

---

## Data Integrity Concerns

### Critical Issue: Inflated Revenue üö®

The dashboard is showing **$1,950.10 more revenue** than actually exists in the source data. This is a serious data integrity problem that could lead to:

- **Overstated financial performance**
- **Incorrect business decisions** based on inflated metrics
- **Loss of trust** in the dashboard accuracy
- **Potential accounting discrepancies**

**This must be fixed before the dashboard can be relied upon for business decisions.**

---

## Files Requiring Updates

1. **[import-multi-week-data.js](import-multi-week-data.js)** - Revenue calculation, NEW membership detection, service counting
2. **[import-weekly-data.js](import-weekly-data.js)** - Membership counting, service categorization
3. **[validate-dashboard-data.js](validate-dashboard-data.js)** - Ongoing validation tool ‚úÖ CREATED

---

## Next Steps

1. Connect to production database to run full validation
2. Implement Priority 1 fix (revenue audit)
3. Test and validate each fix incrementally
4. Document all changes in git commits
5. Re-upload data files to verify fixes work end-to-end
6. Generate final validation report for user
