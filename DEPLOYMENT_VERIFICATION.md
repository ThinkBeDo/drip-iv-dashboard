## üîß Technical Changes Deployed

### Code Changes
1. **server.js**
   - Line 2033-2034: Weight loss injection count assignment
   - Line 3602: Added popular_weight_management to INSERT
   - Line 3688-3694: Added popular services values

2. **Database Migration**
   - Migration 004: Added `popular_weight_management` column

   - Status: ‚úì Applied successfully

### Git Commits Deployed

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations

### Membership Data Shows 0
**This is expected** - Revenue files don't contain membership data.

**Action Required**:
Upload the Active Memberships file:
```bash
curl -X POST https://drip-iv-dashboard-production.up.railway.app/api/upload-memberships \
  -F "file=@Drip IV Active Memberships (3).xlsx"
```

### Monthly Aggregation
The single-week view shows monthly values calculated from that week's file only. For accurate monthly totals across all weeks, the aggregate API would need to be used, but it requires date filtering fixes.

## üß™ Test Commands

### Check Weight Loss Injection Counts
```bash
curl -s https://drip-iv-dashboard-production.up.railway.app/api/dashboard | \
  jq '.data.semaglutide_injections_weekly'
```
Expected: `26`

### Check Popular Services Separation
```bash
curl -s https://drip-iv-dashboard-production.up.railway.app/api/dashboard | \
  jq '{injections: .data.popular_injections, weight_management: .data.popular_weight_management}'
```
Expected: Injections = B12/Glutathione, Weight Management = Tirzepatide/Semaglutide

### Check All Service Counts
```bash
curl -s https://drip-iv-dashboard-production.up.railway.app/api/dashboard | \
  jq '{
    iv_infusions: (.data.iv_infusions_weekday_weekly + .data.iv_infusions_weekend_weekly),
    regular_injections: (.data.injections_weekday_weekly + .data.injections_weekend_weekly),
    weight_loss_injections: .data.semaglutide_injections_weekly
  }'
```
Expected: `{iv_infusions: 76, regular_injections: 19, weight_loss_injections: 26}`

## üéâ Conclusion

**All requested fixes have been successfully deployed and verified in production.**

The live dashboard at https://drip-iv-dashboard-production.up.railway.app is now correctly:
