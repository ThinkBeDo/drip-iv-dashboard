## üîç Root Cause Analysis

### Two Issues Identified:

#### 1. **Column Index Bug in `extractFromExcel()` function**
   - **Location**: `server.js` lines 947-950
   - **Problem**: Wrong column indices used to extract data from Excel file
   - **Impact**: Was reading wrong columns, potentially missing or misreading data
   
   **Before (Incorrect)**:
   ```javascript
   const chargeDesc = row[7];      // Column 8 - WRONG!
   const paymentAmount = row[13];  // Column 14 - WRONG!
   ```
   
   **After (Fixed)**:
   ```javascript
   const chargeDesc = row[8];      // Column 9 - "Charge Desc" ‚úì
   const paymentAmount = row[14];  // Column 15 - "Calculated Payment (Line)" ‚úì
   ```

#### 2. **Contrave Office Visit Miscategorization**
   - **Location**: `server.js` line 661 (revenueCategoryMapping)
   - **Problem**: "Contrave Office Visit" was categorized as `semaglutide_revenue` (Weight Loss)
   - **Impact**: 2 Contrave visits √ó $60 = $120 incorrectly added to Weight Loss revenue
   
   **Analysis**:
   - Contrave Office Visit is a consultation/office visit, not a weight loss medication injection
   - Should be categorized as `other_revenue` instead
   - Semaglutide and Tirzepatide are the actual weight loss medications

## ‚úÖ Changes Made to `server.js`

### Change 1: Fixed Column Indices
**Line 947-950**:
```javascript
// Extract Column 9 (Charge Desc) and Column 15 (Calculated Payment)
// Note: Array is 0-indexed, so Column 9 = index 8, Column 15 = index 14
const chargeDesc = row[8]; // Column 9 - "Charge Desc"
const paymentAmount = row[14]; // Column 15 - "Calculated Payment (Line)"
```

### Change 2: Removed Contrave from Weight Loss Category
**Line 658-662**:
```javascript
semaglutide_revenue: [
  'Semaglutide Monthly', 'Semaglutide Weekly', 'Tirzepatide Monthly', 
  'Tirzepatide Weekly', 'Partner Tirzepatide', 'Weight Loss Program Lab Bundle',
  'Weight Management', 'GLP-1', 'Ozempic', 'Wegovy'
  // Removed: 'Contrave Office Visit'
],
```

### Change 3: Added Contrave to Other Revenue Category
**Line 674**:
```javascript
other_revenue: ['Lab Draw Fee', 'TOTAL_TIPS', 'Contrave Office Visit']
```

## üìù Recommendations

1. **Update Dashboard Display**: The next time you upload the Excel file, Weight Loss revenue should show $9,940.00 instead of $10,060.00

2. **Verify Other Categories**: Consider reviewing other revenue categories to ensure no similar miscategorizations exist

3. **Documentation**: Update any internal documentation that defines what counts as "Weight Loss" revenue to clarify that office visits/consultations are separate from medication charges

4. **Future Consideration**: If Contrave office visits should be tracked separately, consider creating a dedicated "Consultations" or "Office Visits" revenue category
