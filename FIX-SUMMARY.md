# Data Validation Fix Summary

## Issue Identified

From deployment logs, the week **Sep 29 - Oct 5, 2025** exists in the database but has:
- ✅ **120 members** (correct)
- ❌ **$0.00 revenue** (incorrect - should have transaction data)

When users click "Last Week" filter, the dashboard correctly queries this week but returns zeros because the database record contains zero revenue.

## Root Cause

The import process was:
1. Successfully parsing membership data ✅
2. **FAILING** to parse revenue/transaction data ❌
3. Overwriting existing database records with zero values
4. No validation to prevent this data corruption

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Import Validation (`import-multi-week-data.js`)
**Lines 268-275:** Added validation to reject uploads with zero revenue
```javascript
const hasRevenue = weekData.actual_weekly_revenue && weekData.actual_weekly_revenue > 0;
if (!hasRevenue) {
  throw new Error('Import validation failed: No revenue transactions found...');
}
```

### 2. Data Integrity Checks (`import-multi-week-data.js`)
**Lines 290-302:** Added protection against overwriting good data
```javascript
if (existingRevenue > 0 && newRevenue === 0) {
  throw new Error('Data integrity check failed: Refusing to overwrite...');
}
```

### 3. Fixed "Most Recent Week" Logic (`import-multi-week-data.js`)
**Lines 491-502:** Now correctly returns week with latest `week_end_date`
```javascript
const mostRecentWeek = savedRecords.reduce((latest, current) => {
  const latestEndDate = new Date(latest.week_end_date);
  const currentEndDate = new Date(current.week_end_date);
  return currentEndDate > latestEndDate ? current : latest;
}, savedRecords[0]);
```

### 4. Enhanced Error Feedback (`server.js`)
**Lines 3376-3406:** Added detailed validation results and troubleshooting
```javascript
validation: {
  revenuePresent: importedData.actual_weekly_revenue > 0,
  customersPresent: importedData.unique_customers_weekly > 0,
  transactionCount: importedData.unique_customers_weekly || 0
}
```

## What This Fixes

### Before
- ❌ Zero-revenue uploads silently overwrite good data
- ❌ No validation or error messages
- ❌ Client uploads data, sees zeros, doesn't know why

### After
- ✅ Zero-revenue uploads are **REJECTED** with clear error message
- ✅ Existing good data is **PROTECTED** from bad overwrites
- ✅ Client gets immediate feedback: "No revenue transactions found"
- ✅ Error messages include troubleshooting guidance

## Action Required

### For Current Issue
The **Sep 29 - Oct 5** week needs to be **re-uploaded** with proper revenue data:
1. Client uploads the correct Excel file for this week
2. New validation ensures it has revenue data before saving
3. Dashboard will immediately show correct numbers

### For Future Uploads
- All uploads now validated automatically
- Bad data uploads will be rejected with helpful error messages
- Database integrity protected from zero-revenue overwrites

## Testing Notes

The test script (`test-data-validation.js`) is included but requires production `DATABASE_URL` to run. It validates:
1. Week existence in database
2. Date calculation logic (frontend → backend)
3. Exact week match queries
4. Available weeks listing
5. New validation logic simulation

## Files Modified

1. **import-multi-week-data.js**
   - Added import validation (lines 268-275)
   - Added data integrity checks (lines 284-304)
   - Fixed most recent week logic (lines 491-502)

2. **server.js**
   - Enhanced error feedback (lines 3376-3406)
   - Added validation status in response

3. **test-data-validation.js** (new)
   - Comprehensive test suite for validation

## Deployment

Ready to commit and push to GitHub → Railway auto-deploys.

The validation will take effect immediately. Next upload will be properly validated.
