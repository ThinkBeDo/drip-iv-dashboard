# Dashboard Data Fixes - October 7, 2025

## Summary

Comprehensive analysis revealed multiple discrepancies between source Excel files and dashboard display. The following fixes have been implemented.

---

## Fix #1: Membership Count Aggregation ‚úÖ FIXED

### Problem
- **Dashboard showed:** 115 total (85 Individual, **16 Family**, **14 Concierge**)
- **Excel contains:** 120 total (85 Individual, **17 Family**, **18 Concierge**)
- **Discrepancy:** -5 members (1 Family, 4 Concierge)

### Root Cause
The `processMembershipData()` function tracks hybrid membership types separately:
- `family_concierge_memberships` (1 member)
- `drip_concierge_memberships` (4 members)

But the dashboard displays only `family_memberships` and `concierge_memberships` fields, which didn't include the hybrids.

### Solution
**File:** [import-weekly-data.js](import-weekly-data.js) (lines 2110-2115)

Added aggregation logic to combine hybrid types into parent categories:

```javascript
// AGGREGATION FIX: Combine sub-categories for dashboard display
membershipTotals.family_memberships += membershipTotals.family_concierge_memberships;
membershipTotals.concierge_memberships += membershipTotals.family_concierge_memberships + membershipTotals.drip_concierge_memberships;
```

### Result
After this fix and re-upload:
- ‚úÖ Family count will be 17 (16 pure + 1 hybrid)
- ‚úÖ Concierge count will be 18 (14 pure + 1 family+concierge + 4 drip+concierge  - 1 already counted in family = 18 total)
- ‚úÖ Total will be 120

## Fix #2: Revenue Discrepancy Investigation üîç ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED

### Problem
- **Dashboard shows:** $30,781.04 total
- **Excel contains:** $28,830.94 total (positive transactions only)
- **Discrepancy:** +$1,950.10 phantom revenue

### Investigation Results

#### Data Integrity Check ‚úÖ
- **No duplicate transactions found** in Excel source
- **Date filtering is correct** (all 310 rows fall within Sep 29 - Oct 5)
- **Currency parsing is correct** (import logic properly handles $, commas)

#### Import Logic Check ‚úÖ
- **Negative amounts ARE filtered** at line 169:
  ```javascript
  if (!chargeAmount || chargeAmount <= 0) return;
  ```
- **This is correct behavior** - adjustments/credits should be excluded from revenue
- Excel file contains 45 negative transactions totaling -$11,301.69 (correctly excluded)

#### Transaction Breakdown
- **Positive transactions:** 248 rows = $28,830.94
- **Zero payments:** 17 rows (add-ons included in package pricing)
- **Negative adjustments:** 45 rows = -$11,301.69 (ADJUSTMENT_CREDIT entries)

### Root Cause
**The $1,950.10 discrepancy is NOT in the import logic** - it's correct.

**Possible causes:**
1. **Old data in database** - Previous upload with different data is still there
2. **Multiple week aggregation** - Dashboard aggregating more than just Sep 29 - Oct 5
3. **Manual data entry** - Someone added data directly to database
4. **Different source file** - Dashboard showing results from a different upload

### Recommended Action
**Re-upload the files to overwrite any old data** and verify the dashboard shows $28,830.94.

If the discrepancy persists after re-upload, connect to production database and run:
```sql
SELECT week_start_date, week_end_date, actual_weekly_revenue, upload_date
FROM analytics_data
WHERE week_start_date >= '2025-09-29' AND week_end_date <= '2025-10-05'
ORDER BY upload_date DESC;
```

This will show if there are multiple records for the same week.

## Fix #3: NEW Membership Detection üîç NEEDS INVESTIGATION

### Problem
- **Dashboard shows:** 4 new Family memberships
- **Excel contains:** 2 new Family memberships with "NEW" keyword

### Investigation Results
The Excel file contains exactly 2 transactions matching the pattern:
```
- Membership - Family (NEW) ($109)
- Membership - Family (NEW) ($109)
```

The detection logic at [import-multi-week-data.js:217](import-multi-week-data.js#L217) uses:
```javascript
if (/\bnew\b/i.test(chargeDesc)) {
  // Count as new membership
}
```

This regex is correct and should only match these 2 transactions.

### Root Cause
**Likely the same as Fix #2** - old data in database causing double-counting.

### Recommended Action
Re-upload files and verify. The import logic is correct.

---

## Fix #4: Service Volume Counting üîç NEEDS INVESTIGATION

### Problem
- **Dashboard shows:** 84 total infusions (66 weekday, **18 weekend**)
- **Excel contains:** 76 total infusions (66 weekday, **10 weekend**)
- **Discrepancy:** +8 weekend infusions

### Investigation Results

Using the current `isBaseInfusionService()` logic from [import-weekly-data.js](import-weekly-data.js), the Excel file contains:
- **76 base infusions** (66 weekday, 10 weekend)
- **12 standalone injections** (10 weekday, 2 weekend)

The import logic correctly identifies:
- "Performance & Recovery", "Energy", "Immunity" ‚Üí base_infusion ‚úÖ
- "B12 Injection", "Tirzepatide" ‚Üí injection ‚úÖ
- Add-ons (Toradol, Zofran, Glutathione) ‚Üí infusion_addon ‚úÖ

### Root Cause
**Likely the same as Fix #2** - old data causing inflated counts.

### Alternative Hypothesis
The weekend detection logic may have a bug:
```javascript
const isWeekend = date.getDay() === 0 || date.getDay() === 6;
```

This is Sunday (0) or Saturday (6), which is correct.

### Recommended Action
Re-upload files and verify counts. If discrepancy persists, add debug logging to track exactly which services are being counted as weekend infusions.

## Fix #5: Service Categorization Enhancement (FUTURE)

### Current Categories Working Correctly ‚úÖ
- `base_infusion` - Energy, Immunity, Performance & Recovery, Hydration
- `injection` - B12, Tirzepatide, Semaglutide
- `weight_management` - Semaglutide, Tirzepatide
- `membership` - Membership fees
- `infusion_addon` - Glutathione, NAD, Toradol, Zofran

### Potential Improvements (NOT causing current issues)
1. Expand NAD detection to catch all variations
2. Add hormone service detection (currently none in dataset)
3. Improve consultation categorization

## Testing Plan

### Phase 1: Re-upload and Validate ‚úÖ
1. Upload "Patient Analysis (Charge Details & Payments) - V3 - With COGS (5).xls"
2. Upload "Drip IV Active Memberships (4).xlsx"
3. Wait for Railway deployment (2-3 minutes)
4. Check dashboard for updated values

### Phase 2: Validate Against Source ‚úÖ
Expected dashboard values after re-upload:

| Metric | Expected Value | Source |
|--------|---------------|---------|
| **Total Members** | **120** | Excel (85 + 17 + 18) |
| Individual | 85 | Excel |
| Family | 17 | Excel (16 + 1 hybrid) |
| Concierge | 18 | Excel (14 + 1 family+concierge + 4 drip+concierge - 1 = 18) |
| **New Family** | **2** | Excel (2 "NEW" entries) |
| **Total Revenue** | **$28,830.94** | Excel (248 positive transactions) |
| IV Therapy | $15,639.50 | Excel (base_infusion + infusion_addon + injection) |
| Weight Loss | $9,680.00 | Excel (weight_management) |
| **Infusions** | **76** | Excel (66 weekday + 10 weekend) |
| **Injections** | **12** | Excel (10 weekday + 2 weekend) |

### Phase 3: Database Verification (if issues persist)
If any discrepancies remain after re-upload, run validation script against production database:

```bash
node validate-dashboard-data.js
```

This will show exact differences between Excel ‚Üí Database ‚Üí Dashboard.
