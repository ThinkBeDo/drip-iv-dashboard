## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### 1. **Column Index Bug** (Critical)
- **File**: `server.js` lines 947-950
- **Issue**: Reading wrong columns from Excel file
- **Fix**: Changed from indices 7,13 to correct indices 8,14

```javascript
// BEFORE (Wrong)
const chargeDesc = row[7];      // Was reading wrong column
const paymentAmount = row[13];  // Was reading wrong column

// AFTER (Fixed)
const chargeDesc = row[8];      // ✓ Now reads "Charge Desc" correctly
const paymentAmount = row[14];  // ✓ Now reads "Calculated Payment" correctly
```

### 2. **Contrave Miscategorization**
- **File**: `server.js` line 658-674
- **Issue**: "Contrave Office Visit" counted as Weight Loss medication
- **Fix**: Moved from `semaglutide_revenue` to `other_revenue`

**Impact**: 2 Contrave visits × $60 = $120 removed from Weight Loss
