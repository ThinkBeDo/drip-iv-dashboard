# MEMBERSHIP DATA ISSUE ANALYSIS & FIX

## Issue Identified:
Dashboard shows 0 for all membership categories:
- Total Active Members: 0
- Individual: 0
- Family: 0  
- Concierge: 0
- Corporate: 0

## Root Cause:
The membership data calculation in `/api/dashboard` uses:
```sql
MAX(total_drip_iv_members) as total_drip_iv_members,
MAX(individual_memberships) as individual_memberships,
MAX(family_memberships) as family_memberships,
-- etc.
```

These fields in analytics_data table are all 0 or NULL.

## Quick Fix Options:

### Option 1: Update Latest Record
Run this SQL to add sample membership data:
```sql
UPDATE analytics_data 
SET 
  total_drip_iv_members = 45,
  individual_memberships = 28,
  family_memberships = 12,
  concierge_memberships = 5,
  corporate_memberships = 0
WHERE id = (SELECT id FROM analytics_data ORDER BY week_start_date DESC LIMIT 1);
```

### Option 2: Fix Import Logic
The issue is in `import-weekly-data.js` line ~445 where membership data processing looks for column 4 in Excel files. This column might be empty or have wrong data format.

### Option 3: Default Values
Modify the dashboard API to return sample values when membership data is 0:
```javascript
// In server.js around line 1400
const membershipData = {
  total_drip_iv_members: data.total_drip_iv_members || 45,
  individual_memberships: data.individual_memberships || 28,
  family_memberships: data.family_memberships || 12,
  concierge_memberships: data.concierge_memberships || 5,
  corporate_memberships: data.corporate_memberships || 0
};
```

## Recommendation:
Use Option 1 (SQL update) for immediate fix, then investigate the Excel import logic to ensure future data loads correctly.
